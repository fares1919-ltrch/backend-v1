# Profile Page and CPF Integration Enhancement Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to improve the profile page functionality and its integration with CPF requests, ensuring a more professional and user-friendly experience.

## Current Analysis

### Profile Implementation

- Uses reactive form with comprehensive validation
- Has sections for personal and professional information
- Includes profile photo upload capability
- Handles password changes and session management

### CPF Request Requirements

Essential fields needed:

- Identity Number (8-12 digits)
- Birth Date (must be 18+ years old)
- Address

### Current Issues

- Profile saving works but needs better validation for CPF-required fields
- No clear indication which fields are required for CPF requests
- No direct link between profile completion and CPF request capability

- Provide direct links to complete missing information

### 5. Technical Implementation

- Update form validation rules
- Enhance error handling
- Improve data persistence
- Add real-time validation feedback

## Next Steps

1. Implement UI changes for required fields
2. Update validation logic
