# CPF System API Reference

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the CPF System API endpoints, authentication mechanisms, and usage patterns. It complements the Swagger documentation accessible at `/api-docs` when the server is running.

## API Overview

The CPF System API is organized into several logical groups of endpoints that handle different aspects of the CPF issuance process:

1. **Authentication API**: User registration, login, and token management
2. **CPF Request API**: Submission and management of CPF requests
3. **Appointment API**: Scheduling and management of center appointments
4. **Biometric Data API**: Collection and verification of biometric information
5. **CPF Credential API**: Issuance and verification of CPF credentials
6. **Center API**: Management of service centers
7. **Notification API**: User notification handling
8. **Statistics API**: System-wide statistics and reporting

## Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to the base URL:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

For production environments, the base URL will be the deployed domain.

## Authentication

### Authentication Methods

The API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. There are several ways to authenticate:

1. **Username/Password**: Traditional username and password login
2. **OAuth Providers**: Google and GitHub OAuth integration
3. **Refresh Token**: Extending sessions using refresh tokens

### Using JWT Tokens

Once authenticated, include the JWT token in the Authorization header for all protected requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

### Token Lifecycle

1. **Obtaining a Token**: Via login or OAuth authentication
2. **Token Expiration**: Tokens expire after the configured timeout (default: 1 hour)
3. **Token Refresh**: Use refresh token to obtain a new access token
4. **Token Revocation**: Logging out invalidates the token

## Common Request/Response Patterns

### Pagination

Many list endpoints support pagination with the following query parameters:

```
?page=1&limit=10
```

Paginated responses include:

```json
{
  "items": [...],
  "totalPages": 5,
  "currentPage": 1,
  "totalItems": 42
}
```

### Filtering

List endpoints often support filtering with query parameters:

```
?status=pending&startDate=2023-01-01&endDate=2023-12-31
```

### Sorting

Some endpoints support sorting:

```
?sortBy=createdAt&order=desc
```

### Error Responses

Error responses follow this structure:

```json
{
  "message": "Error message explaining what went wrong",
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "details": {}
  }
}
```

Common HTTP status codes:

- **200**: Success
- **201**: Created
- **400**: Bad Request (client error)
- **401**: Unauthorized (authentication required)
- **403**: Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- **404**: Not Found
- **409**: Conflict
- **422**: Unprocessable Entity (validation failed)
- **429**: Too Many Requests (rate limiting)
- **500**: Internal Server Error

## API Integration Examples

  participant User
  participant Auth API
  participant CPF API
  participant Appointment API
  participant Biometric API
  participant Credential API
  
  User->>Auth API: POST /api/auth/signin
  Auth API-->>User: JWT Token
  
  User->>CPF API: POST /api/cpf-requests
  CPF API-->>User: Request Created (status: pending)
  
  Note over CPF API: Officer reviews request
  
  CPF API-->>User: Request Approved
  
  User->>Appointment API: GET /api/appointments/slots
  Appointment API-->>User: Available Slots
  
  User->>Appointment API: POST /api/appointments
  Appointment API-->>User: Appointment Scheduled
  
  Note over User: User visits center
  
  Note over Biometric API: Officer collects biometrics
  
  Biometric API->>CPF API: Request Status Update
  
  Credential API->>User: CPF Credential Issued
```

### Example: Administrative Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Manager
  participant Auth API
  participant Center API
  participant Stats API
  
  Manager->>Auth API: POST /api/auth/signin
  Auth API-->>Manager: JWT Token
  
  Manager->>Center API: POST /api/centers
  Center API-->>Manager: Center Created
  
  Manager->>Center API: PUT /api/centers/{id}/capacity
  Center API-->>Manager: Capacity Updated
  
  Manager->>Stats API: GET /api/stats/overview
  Stats API-->>Manager: System Statistics
```

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse:

- Authentication endpoints: 5 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- Other endpoints: 100 requests per minute per user

When rate limit is exceeded, the response will have status code 429 with a message indicating when the limit will reset.

## Webhooks

The system supports webhooks for certain events:

- CPF request status changes
- Appointment status changes
- Credential issuance or revocation

To register a webhook, use:

```
POST /api/webhooks
```

with your endpoint URL and the events you want to subscribe to.

## Best Practices

1. **Always validate tokens**: Ensure your JWT token is valid before making requests
2. **Handle token expiration**: Be prepared to refresh tokens when they expire
3. **Implement proper error handling**: Account for various HTTP status codes
4. **Use pagination**: For list endpoints, always use pagination to limit response size
5. **Rate limiting awareness**: Implement backoff strategies for rate limit errors

## API Versioning

The current API version is v1. When new versions are released, they will be available at:

```
/api/v2/...
```

The current version will be maintained for backward compatibility according to the deprecation policy.

## API Health Check

To check if the API is available:

```
GET /api/health
```

This endpoint returns a simple status message and does not require authentication.
