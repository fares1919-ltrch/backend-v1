## Business Logic

### Appointment Creation
1. Validates officer role
2. Checks CPF request status
3. Prevents duplicate appointments
4. Updates CPF request status
5. Creates appointment record

### Status Updates
1. Only officers can update status
2. Status flow:
   - Initial: scheduled
   - Completion: completed
   - Cancellation: cancelled
   - No-show: missed
3. Updates related CPF request status

### Rescheduling
1. Validates officer role
2. Checks new date validity
3. Updates appointment and CPF request status
4. Maintains audit trail

## Security Features

1. Role-based Access Control
   - Officers can create, update, and delete appointments
   - Users can view and reschedule their own appointments
   - All operations require proper authentication

2. Data Validation
   - Date format validation
   - Center working hours validation
   - Prevents overlapping appointments
   - Role validation for all operations

## Integration Points

1. CPF Requests
   - Links to CPF requests
   - Updates CPF request status
   - Prevents duplicate appointments

2. Centers
   - Uses center working hours
   - Links to center location
   - Manages center capacity

3. Users
   - Links to users
   - Role-based access control
   - Notification system integration

## Error Handling

1. Common Error Cases:
   - Invalid date formats
   - Missing required parameters
   - Unauthorized access
   - Duplicate appointments
   - Non-existent resources

2. Error Responses:
   - 400: Bad Request
   - 401: Unauthorized
   - 403: Forbidden
   - 404: Not Found
   - 500: Internal Server Error

## Best Practices

1. Always validate user and officer roles before operations
2. Check CPF request status before creating appointments
3. Maintain proper audit trail for all changes
4. Use proper date formatting and time zone handling
5. Implement rate limiting for appointment creation
6. Use optimistic locking for concurrent updates
